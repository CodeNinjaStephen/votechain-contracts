# Mainnet Deployment Runbook

> **Audience:** Release engineers and on-call engineers performing or reviewing a mainnet deployment.
> **Related:** [`scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh`](../scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh), [`.github/workflows/deploy-mainnet.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-mainnet.yml)

## Overview

VoteChain mainnet deployments follow a **build → staging → manual approval → mainnet** pipeline enforced by GitHub Actions and GitHub Environments.

## Prerequisites

Before cutting a release tag, confirm all of the following:

| Check | Command / Location |
|-------|--------------------|
| All CI checks pass on `main` | GitHub Actions → CI workflow |
| Security audit clean | `cargo audit` in CI |
| WASM size within budget | CI build-wasm job |
| `CHANGELOG.md` updated | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| ADRs updated if architecture changed | `docs/adr/` |
| At least one reviewer available to approve | GitHub → Settings → Environments → mainnet |
| `MAINNET_SECRET_KEY` secret set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions |
| `MAINNET_ADMIN_ADDRESS` secret set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions |
| `STAGING_SECRET_KEY` secret set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions |
| `STAGING_ADMIN_ADDRESS` secret set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions |

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create and push a version tag

```bash
# Ensure you are on the latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Tag follows semver: v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

This triggers the `deploy-mainnet.yml` workflow automatically.

### 2. Monitor the CI verification step

Open **GitHub Actions → Deploy to Mainnet** and watch the **Verify CI Green** job.

- The job polls for up to 10 minutes waiting for any in-progress CI runs on the same commit to finish.
- If CI has not passed it aborts with `❌ CI did not pass`.
- If CI passed it continues to the next job.

### 3. WASM artifact download

The **Download CI WASM Artifact** job locates the `wasm-contracts-*` artifact produced by the
CI `build-wasm` job for the exact commit being released.

> **Important:** No re-build occurs. The mainnet binary is byte-for-byte identical to what CI tested.

If the artifact cannot be found (e.g., the CI run expired after 90 days), the job fails with
`❌ No wasm-contracts artifact found`. In that case re-run CI on the tag's commit and retry.

### 4. Review the staging deploy

The **Deploy to Staging** job deploys to Stellar testnet using the `staging` GitHub Environment.

- Outputs: token contract ID and governance contract ID on testnet.
- Smoke tests call `total_supply` on the token contract to verify it is live.

Check the step logs before approving the mainnet gate.

### 5. Approve the mainnet gate

After staging passes, the workflow pauses at the **Await Mainnet Approval** job.

A notification appears in:
- GitHub Actions timeline (yellow dot on the `Await Mainnet Approval` job)
- Email/Slack if GitHub notification routing is configured for the `mainnet` Environment

**To approve:**
1. Go to **GitHub Actions → Deploy to Mainnet → the paused run**.
2. Click **Review deployments**.
3. Select the `mainnet` environment and click **Approve and deploy**.

> At least the number of required reviewers configured for the `mainnet` Environment must approve.
> The account that pushed the tag cannot self-approve (configured on the Environment).

### 6. Verify the mainnet deploy

After approval the **Deploy to Mainnet** job runs. Check the logs for:

```
✅ Token deployed: C...
✅ Governance deployed: C...
```

The contract IDs are also captured as job outputs and used in the release notes.

### 7. Confirm config/mainnet.toml commit

A bot commit appears on `main` updating `config/mainnet.toml` with the new contract addresses.
Verify the commit message:

```
chore: update mainnet contract addresses for v1.2.3 [skip ci]
```

### 8. Verify the GitHub Release

Navigate to **GitHub → Releases → v1.2.3** and confirm:

- Token and governance contract addresses are correct.
- WASM SHA-256 hashes are listed.
- Both WASM files are attached as release assets.

## Environment Configuration

### Required GitHub Environments

| Environment | Used by | Required reviewers |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `staging` | `deploy-staging` job | None (automated) |
| `mainnet` | `await-approval` and `deploy-mainnet` jobs | **Set to ≥ 1 (recommend 2)** |

**Setting up the `mainnet` Environment:**
1. GitHub → Settings → Environments → New environment → `mainnet`
2. Enable **Required reviewers** and add the release engineers.
3. Enable **Prevent self-review**.
4. Optionally set **Deployment branch rules** to tags matching `v*.*.*` only.

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Environment | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `MAINNET_SECRET_KEY` | `mainnet` | Stellar secret key for the deployer account |
| `MAINNET_ADMIN_ADDRESS` | `mainnet` | Stellar address that will be the contract admin |
| `STAGING_SECRET_KEY` | `staging` | Stellar secret key for staging deployer |
| `STAGING_ADMIN_ADDRESS` | `staging` | Stellar address for staging admin |

Set secrets at: **GitHub → Settings → Environments → \<env\> → Environment secrets**.

> **Security:** Never commit secret keys to the repository. Rotate keys immediately if exposed.

## Manual Deployment (Break-Glass)

If the GitHub Actions pipeline is unavailable, use `scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh` directly
after following all the pre-flight checks above.

```bash
# Dry-run first
STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=$KEY \
STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS=$ADMIN \
./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh --mainnet --dry-run

# Real deploy (requires interactive confirmation)
STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=$KEY \
STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS=$ADMIN \
./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh --mainnet
```

After a manual deploy, manually update `config/mainnet.toml` and create a GitHub Release.

---

## Logging and Log Rotation

Production containers (`backend`, `indexer`) log structured JSON to stdout. Local `json-file`
rotation (`docker-compose.yml`, 100MB × 5 files per service) bounds host disk usage, but mainnet
deployments must also ship logs to a centralised backend (Loki or CloudWatch Logs) with **30-day
retention**. See [docs/logging.md](logging.md) for driver configuration and retention setup.

---

## Rollback

There is no on-chain contract rollback. Once deployed, a contract is immutable.

Mitigation options:

1. **Pause the contract** — Call `pause(admin)` to block all state-changing operations.
2. **Deploy a new version** — Push a new version tag to trigger a new deployment.
3. **Update config** — Point `config/mainnet.toml` to the new contract addresses.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `❌ No wasm-contracts artifact found`

The CI artifact for this commit has expired (90-day retention) or CI has not run.
- Re-run the CI workflow on the tag commit.
- Re-push the tag after CI completes: `git push origin v1.2.3 --force` (only if tag is wrong).

### `❌ CI did not pass`

Fix the failing CI check, push a new tag (e.g., `v1.2.4`), and restart the process.

### Stellar CLI errors during deploy

- Ensure `MAINNET_SECRET_KEY` is a funded mainnet account.
- Check RPC URL is reachable: `curl https://horizon.stellar.org`.
- Verify the deployer account has sufficient XLM for transaction fees.

### Approval gate not appearing

- Confirm the `mainnet` GitHub Environment exists and has required reviewers.
- Check the Actions run is not stuck on a prior step.
