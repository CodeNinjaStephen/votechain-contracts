> Note: `ADR-007` and `ADR-001` each already have more than one file in this
> directory from earlier, independently-merged PRs
> (`ADR-007-delegation-design.md`, `ADR-007-multisig-admin.md`,
> `ADR-007-voting-power-snapshot.md`; `ADR-001-contract-upgrade-strategy.md`,
> `ADR-001-stellar-soroban-platform.md`). ADR-013/014/015 (this addition) use
> the next free numbers after the existing maximum (ADR-012) rather than the
> `ADR-007`/`ADR-008`/`ADR-009` numbers originally suggested in issue #77, to
> avoid adding a fourth collision on top of the existing ones. Renumbering the
> existing duplicates is out of scope here and left for a separate cleanup.
