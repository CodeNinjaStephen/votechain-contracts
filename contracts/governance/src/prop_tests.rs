//! Property-based tests for vote tally invariants.
//!
//! These tests operate on plain arithmetic that mirrors the tally logic in
//! `GovernanceContract::cast_vote` and `finalise`, without requiring a
//! Soroban execution environment.
//!
//! ## Issue #58 — Edge quorum coverage
//!
//! The tests in this module now also cover the three quorum edge cases
//! identified in issue #58:
//!
//! 1. `quorum = 1` — minimum possible quorum; any single token holder can pass.
//! 2. `quorum = total_supply` — maximum quorum; every token must participate.
//! 3. `total_votes == quorum` — boundary; passes iff `yes > no`.
//! 4. `total_votes == quorum - 1` — just below boundary; always rejects.
